### 3️⃣ How to Push Changes Live Immediately

Any time you:
- Edit `prayer-times.json`
- Add/remove posters

The system will automatically update **within 5 minutes**, even if you don’t do anything else.

However, if the update is **urgent** and you want it to appear on the live screen **within a minute**, you should also update the `version.json` file to force a refresh.

#### Steps to Trigger Immediate Refresh:
1. Open [`version.json`](./version.json)
2. Click the **pencil icon** ✏️
3. Change the version from `"1"` to `"2"`, or from `"2"` to `"1"` (just switch between them).
   
   Example:
   ```json
   { "version": "2" }
   ```
4. Click **“Commit changes”**.

That’s it! The screen at the masjid will detect the version change and automatically reload to apply your updates almost immediately.
